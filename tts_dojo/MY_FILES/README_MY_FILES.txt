This is the default folder for collecting files needed to train your model.

It requires the following:

a WAV directory containing audio samples in the target voice
a metadata.csv file containing text transcripts of the WAV files
a .ckpt file for a partially trained TTS model.

after copying those files here,
use the 'add_my_files.sh' script after creating a new dojo
to copy these components into the expected folders.
